This is a project that I completed for my AI class. This was completed in Jupyter notebooks using python 3.

In the notebook you will see that the file location for the import is blank("____") this would be for a local location of a csv file. 
The data used in this project was pulled from Yahoo finance for Amazon. 

Initially, learning was done from the entire Amazon dataset but data was heavily skewed because of major increases in the value over the last few years. 
After training was finished and tested, I decided to trim the data to represent the last year. The trimmed data was used to relearn and then was tested again against
a more recent dataset.  The test data was derived from 6 weeks of recent data.
